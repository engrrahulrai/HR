# HR
* Created a Project of Employee Management System.
* Created a Java based application for managing the data of employees. In this project I have used Layered Programming Concept in which I have created Data Layer, Business Layer and Presentation Layer.
* After completing all Layers I have connected the Project to the Data Base by creating another layer and connect it to the Business Layer directly in the place of Data Layer.
* Then after all I have converted the Application into Network Application without changing the Single Line in the rest of the
layers.
